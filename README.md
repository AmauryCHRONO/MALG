# Mathematics - Linear Algebra

Repository of "Mathematics - Linear Algebra".
This module aims to teach us how to:
- To reformulate linear algebra in a less abstract way than in the preparatory class
- To show that linear algebra can be used to model application problems encountered in many fields
in many fields: computer science, image processing, physics, and even numerical
numerical analysis
- Solve these problems which are most often modelled by equations of the form
𝐀𝐱 = 𝐛 where 𝐀 is a matrix and 𝐱, 𝐛 are vectors
- Introduce the use of Matlab and design algorithms for solving
problems specific to matrix computing
